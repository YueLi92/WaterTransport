The scripts in this folder are an adaption of the WAM-2layers model developed by Ruud van der Ent from Delft University (https://github.com/ruudvdent/WAM2layersPython). An explanation on the code can be found in his dissertation (Van der Ent, R. J. (2014), A new view on the hydrological cycle over continents, Ph.D. thesis, 96 pp, Delft University of Technology, Delft. http://dx.doi.org/10.4233/uuid:0ab824ee-6956-4cc3-b530-3245ab4f32be.).

I'm intended to use these codes to explore reanalysis data. Currently, nothing changes happen to the original codes.
